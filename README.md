# Recommender Systems with Collaborative Filtering and SVD++

## Overview

This project implements and compares two types of recommender systems:
- **Collaborative Filtering (User-based KNN)**
- **SVD++ (Matrix Factorization with Implicit Feedback)**

The models are evaluated on two datasets: **MovieLens 100k** and a **Netflix Prize sample**.  
The goal is to predict user ratings accurately and recommend **new, diverse, and novel** movies.

Evaluation focuses on:
- Hit Rate
- Novelty
- Diversity
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

## Models Implemented

- **Collaborative Filtering (UserKNN)**:
  - Standard cosine similarity
  - UserKNN with average rating adjustment
  - Hybrid UserKNN (combining rating patterns and average behavior)
  - User classification based on rating profiles
  
- **SVD++ (Matrix Factorization)**:
  - Incorporates both explicit ratings and implicit feedback
  - Trained with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
  - Based on the logic and structure proposed in Koren (2008)

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Hit Rate**: Measures if recommended items were unseen by the user.
- **Novelty**: Encourages recommendations of less popular, more unique items.
- **Diversity**: Ensures recommended items are different from each other.
- **RMSE**: Measures prediction error between predicted and true ratings.

## Results and Outcomes

- Both Collaborative Filtering and SVD++ achieved low RMSE scores, with around 1 star prediction error.
- **SVD++** achieved:
  - Better diversity (more varied movie recommendations)
  - Higher novelty (less mainstream movie suggestions)
  - Slightly improved RMSE compared to CF
- The systems successfully recommended **new**, **diverse**, and **novel** movies to users, enhancing discovery and engagement.
